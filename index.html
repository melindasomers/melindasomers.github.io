      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, welcome to my site! My name is Melinda and I hail from northern New Jersey. I attended college at UNC Chapel Hill, where I earned my Bachelor's in Neuroscience. During my time as an undergraduate, I was fortunate to gain a breadth of research experiences in the classroom and by working with several PIs who I am grateful to call my mentors. I started as research assistant with Dr. Kim Ritola helping to launch her viral vector core in the UNC Neuroscience Center. Here, I built my wet lab skills and even worked with rodent models alongside one of our collaborators to see how our viruses were used in action!</p>

      <p>Hoping to dive deeper into working with human research subjects, I connected with Gabriella Alvarez, who at the time was a graduate student in the Psychology & Neuroscience Department, but is now an Assistant Professor of Biological & Health Psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. Under her mentorship, I helped her to launch and collect data for a placebo-controlled, within-subjects, crossover pharmacological intervention and neuroimaging study. We recruited a chronically stressed population of adults and target the inflammation in their brain (with minocycline) to investigate effects on neural reward pathways. For my senior thesis, I accumulated daily survey data from participants to compare within-subjects differences of placebo vs. active minocycline on their daily perceived stress. We found that attenuating neuroinflammation with minocycline has the potential to modulate perceived stress in chronically stressed populations.</p>
      <p>Aiming to dive further into my passion for understanding how humans behave and adjust to a highly social world, I pursued a post-baccalaureate position in Dr. Abigail Marsh's Lab on Social & Affective Neuroscience at Georgetown University. It is here that I have had the opportunity to hone my research skills, particularly data collection, analysis, and scientific writing. Moreover, I have pinpointed my drive to explain what drives human prosociality and how can we motivate more people to connect with and help others. Looking forward, I am applying to Social Psychology PhD programs to prepare for an academic research career, where I hope to one day launch my own lab at an R1 institution.</p>
